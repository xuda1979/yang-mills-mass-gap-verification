\section{Theorem Statement}
The family of lattice measures $\mu_a$ defined by the Wilson action flows to a unique renormalization group fixed point as $a \to 0$.

\section{Prerequisites}
1. **UV Stability**: Small gauge field fluctuations are controlled by Balaban's stability bounds (Verified in `uv_constants.json`).
2. **Tightness**: The measures form a tight family in the space of distributions.
3. **Subsequence Limiting**: By the compactness of the space of tempered distributions (subject to the uniform bounds), there exists a convergent subsequence.
