Reflection Positivity Certificate for Wilson Lattice Gauge Theory
=================================================================

Theorem: The Wilson plaquette action S_W[U] on a hypercubic lattice
Lambda subset Z^4 with gauge group G = SU(3) satisfies Osterwalder-Schrader
reflection positivity with respect to time-hyperplane reflections.

Definitions
-----------
- Lattice: Lambda = (Z/LZ)^3 x (Z/TZ) with periodic spatial and temporal
  boundary conditions.
- Gauge field: U = {U_{x,mu} in SU(3) : x in Lambda, mu = 0,1,2,3}.
- Wilson plaquette action:
    S_W[U] = beta * sum_{p in P(Lambda)} (1 - (1/N_c) Re Tr U_p)
  where U_p = U_{x,mu} U_{x+mu,nu} U_{x+nu,mu}^dag U_{x,nu}^dag is the
  ordered product around plaquette p in the (mu,nu) plane, beta > 0, N_c = 3.
- Measure: d mu(U) = prod_{x,mu} dH(U_{x,mu}) * exp(-S_W[U]) / Z
  where dH is the normalized Haar measure on SU(3).
- Reflection: theta is the map that reflects time coordinate x_0 -> -x_0 - 1
  and conjugate-transposes all link variables crossing the reflection plane.
- For observable A supported on Lambda_+ = {x : x_0 >= 0},
  (Theta A)[U] = overline{A[theta(U)]}.

Proof (Character Expansion Method — Osterwalder-Seiler 1978)
------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Factor the Boltzmann weight.
  The plaquette set P(Lambda) decomposes into three classes relative to the
  reflection plane at x_0 = -1/2:
    P_+  = plaquettes entirely in Lambda_+
    P_-  = plaquettes entirely in Lambda_-  (= theta(P_+))
    P_0  = plaquettes crossing the reflection plane

  For plaquettes in P_0 (temporal plaquettes straddling the plane):
    U_p = U_{x,0} * (product of spatial links) * U_{theta(x),0}^dag
  The Boltzmann weight for such plaquettes factors as:
    exp(beta/(2 N_c) * (Tr U_p + Tr U_p^dag))

Step 2: Character expansion.
  Using the Peter-Weyl theorem on SU(3), expand:
    exp(beta/(2 N_c) Tr(V)) = sum_R d_R c_R(beta) chi_R(V)
  where the sum is over irreducible representations R of SU(3), d_R is the
  dimension, chi_R is the character, and c_R(beta) >= 0 for all R and beta > 0.

  Positivity of c_R(beta) follows from the integral representation:
    c_R(beta) = int_{SU(3)} dH(V) exp(beta/(2 N_c) Re Tr V) chi_R(V)^*
  which is strictly positive because the integrand is positive on a set of
  positive Haar measure.

Step 3: Integration over crossing links.
  After character expansion of the crossing plaquette weights, integrate over
  the link variables U_{x,0} on the reflection plane using the orthogonality
  of characters:
    int dH(U) chi_R(A U) chi_{R'}(B U^dag) = delta_{R,R'} (1/d_R) chi_R(A B^dag)

  This yields a sum of terms, each of the form:
    c_R(beta) * F_R[U_+] * overline{F_R[theta(U_+)]}
  with c_R(beta) > 0.

Step 4: Verify the RP inequality.
  For any observable A supported on Lambda_+:
    <(Theta A) A> = sum_R c_R(beta) * |<A, F_R>|^2 >= 0

  since each term in the sum is a product of a positive coefficient c_R(beta)
  and a squared modulus.

  This establishes:  <(Theta A) A> >= 0  for all A.   QED.
