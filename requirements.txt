# Minimal, pure-Python-friendly requirements.
#
# This repository aims to run on a stock CPython install without a native
# compiler toolchain.
#
# Notes:
# - SciPy / Matplotlib / h5py often require binary wheels or a compiler. They are
#   intentionally omitted from the *default* requirements to keep Windows setups
#   working out-of-the-box.
# - If you need plotting or SciPy-based tooling, install those extras separately
#   in an environment with wheels available or a build toolchain.
